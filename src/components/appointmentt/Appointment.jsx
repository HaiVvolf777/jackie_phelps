      description: `"There is an occasion for everything and a time for every activity under heaven." My "occasion" was freedom from prison. And, the "time" was March 13, 2024. The reason why this "activity" is so relevant is that I was sentenced in federal prison to life. I scheduled to die in prison for a cocaine conspiracy. But by the grace of God, along came Jacki Phelps. She delivered me out of prison. Here's the caveat. No other lawyer could do it. My co-defendant and I searched for 27 years. Therefore, Jacki is extraordinary. Most lawyers don't fight federal cases because they can't win. But it is clear no one told Jacki that fact. On top of being a great lawyer, she has a beautiful spirit. She came to visit me the day before she freed me. The way talked to me and cared about my situation. It felt like my sister was coming to fight for me on Mommy's orders. I'm very grateful Jacki came into my life to give me life again. `,

      description: `I was incarcerated for over 27 &1/2 years, for a drug conspiracy that had no tangible drug evidence and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. I felt like, I was left in jail to die in federal prison illegally. My wife sought out Mrs. Jacki Phelps, a lioness, who fearlessly advocate for incarcerated men convicted of drug offenses without
any violence. Never underestimate her punch in such a small package. I will always be forever grateful, to the true advocate, lioness in heart, fighting for those that are rendered voiceless enemies of the State. To have another chance to prove my true worth and contribution to family, friends and society as well. Iâ€™m grateful to have another chance to live my life as a free man. Thank you, Mrs. Jacki Phelps, me and my family will be now and forever grateful for your diligent fight/brawl on my behalf. Words canâ€™t describe the gratitude and respect I have for restoring my voice and Constitutional Rights!!! Wishing you blessings and much success.ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°`,
